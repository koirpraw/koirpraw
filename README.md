## Hi there 👋 Praweg here

### Welcome to my digital workshop.
This is my Personal Repository .My repo  primarily consists of Flutter,React, NextJS & NodeJS projects.
I am not attached to particular language, framework or technique so this might change over time.
I consider myself curious and creative person. I learn by doing things, so i am constantly tinkering with things to learn.
I have been programming and enjoying coding for just couple years now. But i have been hooked to this limitless source of dopamine. I am pretty sure i will still be digging for more in years to come aswell ;)

I have been recenlty working on API series with Node.JS with all possible variation. I am using these projects to build different all possible stacks to build FullStack Web Appliactions ( MERN, PERN ..etc). If you are new to Web development you might find these series helpful.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on: 
   1) Creating Content for my Blog Site [code and curious](codeandcurious.com)
   2) Honing DSA skills with python on JupyterNotebook.
   3) Improving my technical writing skills and good documentation practice

### Currently Learning:
- Python - Web Frameworks ( Fast API, Django/Django Rest Framework)
- Python - Automation/scripting.
- GraphQL

   
- 🌱 I have been currently spending most of my time working on React/NextJS, NodeJS, MongoDB & AWS tools.
